# baggingds
Repository for the Python code for the algorithms in the Information Fusion article _"An investigation into the effects of label noise on Dynamic Selection algorithms"_.

## Using the code

An example is provided in the file ``example_msds.py``. The main file of interest for understanding the proposed method is in ``DynamicSelection/BaggingDS.py``.

## Requirements

* scikit-learn (and its dependencies, e.g. numpy, scipy)
* [deslib](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/DESlib)
